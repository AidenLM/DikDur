## üöÄ Sprint 2 Review & Retrospective

### ‚úÖ Sprint 2 Review

During Sprint 2, significant progress was made in the development of the DikDur platform. We focused on building out the core user-facing components and ensuring that the user flow became more consistent and intuitive. Key accomplishments include:

- The initial version of the **DikDur web platform** was successfully deployed: [dik-dur-website.vercel.app](https://dik-dur-website.vercel.app/)
- Several critical user interfaces were designed and partially implemented:
  - **Login and Registration pages**
  - **HR Dashboard** with posture analytics
  - **Gamification Panel** for challenges and rewards
  - **Virtual Appointment Interface** for physiotherapy sessions
- Navigation between screens was established.
- Design assets (e.g., Figma files) were shared to align development with visual design.

Despite these achievements, Sprint 2 also presented several collaboration and timing challenges.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced During Sprint 2

- üèñÔ∏è **Vacation & Mobility Issues**  
  The sprint took place during the summer break, which meant that many team members were traveling or temporarily unavailable. This affected meeting consistency and timely task completion.

- üíº **Internship Commitments**  
  Several team members were also doing internships. Their differing schedules made synchronous collaboration difficult and reduced working hours across the team.

- üìö **Knowledge Gaps**  
  There were noticeable differences in experience and familiarity with tools among team members. Some had advanced technical knowledge while others were still learning, which caused task imbalances and delays.

- üí¨ **Asynchronous Communication**  
  Most of our communication happened on WhatsApp and other asynchronous platforms due to differing schedules. While this kept the team connected, it made quick decision-making and technical alignment harder.

---

### üîÅ Retrospective ‚Äì Lessons Learned & Recommendations

| Observation | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Sprint overlapped with vacations and internships | Use availability calendars before sprints and assign critical tasks accordingly |
| Technical experience levels varied | Encourage mentoring, pair programming, and mini knowledge-sharing sessions |
| Members changed locations often | Set fixed weekly check-ins regardless of location, with summaries for absentees |
| Overreliance on asynchronous chats | Use shared tools (Notion, Miro) for central task tracking and decisions |
| Lack of documented decisions | Rotate a note-taker each meeting and maintain a visible sprint log |

---

### üìå Looking Ahead ‚Äì Sprint 3 Goals

- Begin backend integration: user authentication, HR module, and user data handling
- Complete gamification system implementation
- Prepare and execute early user testing for core flows
- Improve internal processes through better scheduling and knowledge alignment
