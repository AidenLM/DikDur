## 🚀 Sprint 2 Review & Retrospective

### ✅ Sprint 2 Review

During Sprint 2, significant progress was made in the development of the DikDur platform. We focused on building out the core user-facing components and ensuring that the user flow became more consistent and intuitive. Key accomplishments include:

- The initial version of the **DikDur web platform** was successfully deployed: [dik-dur-website.vercel.app](https://dik-dur-website.vercel.app/)
- Several critical user interfaces were designed and partially implemented:
  - **Login and Registration pages**
  - **HR Dashboard** with posture analytics
  - **Gamification Panel** for challenges and rewards
  - **Virtual Appointment Interface** for physiotherapy sessions
- Navigation between screens was established.
- Design assets (e.g., Figma files) were shared to align development with visual design.

Despite these achievements, Sprint 2 also presented several collaboration and timing challenges.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced During Sprint 2

- 🏖️ **Vacation & Mobility Issues**  
  The sprint took place during the summer break, which meant that many team members were traveling or temporarily unavailable. This affected meeting consistency and timely task completion.

- 💼 **Internship Commitments**  
  Several team members were also doing internships. Their differing schedules made synchronous collaboration difficult and reduced working hours across the team.

- 📚 **Knowledge Gaps**  
  There were noticeable differences in experience and familiarity with tools among team members. Some had advanced technical knowledge while others were still learning, which caused task imbalances and delays.

- 💬 **Asynchronous Communication**  
  Most of our communication happened on WhatsApp and other asynchronous platforms due to differing schedules. While this kept the team connected, it made quick decision-making and technical alignment harder.

---

### 🔁 Retrospective – Lessons Learned & Recommendations

| Observation | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Sprint overlapped with vacations and internships | Use availability calendars before sprints and assign critical tasks accordingly |
| Technical experience levels varied | Encourage mentoring, pair programming, and mini knowledge-sharing sessions |
| Members changed locations often | Set fixed weekly check-ins regardless of location, with summaries for absentees |
| Overreliance on asynchronous chats | Use shared tools  for central task tracking and decisions |
| Lack of documented decisions | Rotate a note-taker each meeting and maintain a visible sprint log |

---

### 📌 Looking Ahead – Sprint 3 Goals

- Begin backend integration: user authentication, HR module, and user data handling
- Complete gamification system implementation
- Prepare and execute early user testing for core flows
- Improve internal processes through better scheduling and knowledge alignment

## Sprint 3 Daily Scrum Summary

During Sprint 3, our team focused on planning, bug fixing, feature development, and polishing the project for the final release. We started with sprint planning and backlog review, quickly identifying and fixing a critical token bug. Unnecessary sections like Challenges and Notifications were removed to streamline the app.

Key features developed included the Posture Cam logic, posture data caching, and averaging logic with user feedback improvements like the "Analyzing..." status. We also redesigned parts of the UI, including Ergonomy and Rewards, and integrated a new logo.

Throughout the sprint, we conducted internal code reviews, cleaned up the codebase, tested authentication caching, and finalized the user interface. The team worked collaboratively to prepare demos, update documentation, and complete the final QA.

By the end of the sprint, all planned goals were met, and we successfully closed the sprint with detailed retrospective notes.
