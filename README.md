**✅ Total Points: 150 — All tasks completed!**
We maintained a burndown chart to track sprint velocity and ensure on-time delivery of features.

Initial backlog estimation: 150 Story Points

Final delivery: 150 Story Points Completed

We earned 100 points in the first sprint and 150 points in the second. With the third sprint, our goal is to reach a total of 400 points. This shows how our teamwork and communication keep improving each sprint.

## 🚀 Sprint 2 Review & Retrospective

### ✅ Sprint 2 Review

During Sprint 2, significant progress was made in the development of the DikDur platform. We focused on building out the core user-facing components and ensuring that the user flow became more consistent and intuitive. Key accomplishments include:

- The initial version of the **DikDur web platform** was successfully deployed: [dik-dur-website.vercel.app](https://dik-dur-website.vercel.app/)
- Several critical user interfaces were designed and partially implemented:
  - **Login and Registration pages**
  - **HR Dashboard** with posture analytics
  - **Gamification Panel** for challenges and rewards
  - **Virtual Appointment Interface** for physiotherapy sessions
- Navigation between screens was established.
- Design assets (e.g., Figma files) were shared to align development with visual design.

Despite these achievements, Sprint 2 also presented several collaboration and timing challenges.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced During Sprint 2

- 🏖️ **Vacation & Mobility Issues**  
  The sprint took place during the summer break, which meant that many team members were traveling or temporarily unavailable. This affected meeting consistency and timely task completion.

- 💼 **Internship Commitments**  
  Several team members were also doing internships. Their differing schedules made synchronous collaboration difficult and reduced working hours across the team.

- 📚 **Knowledge Gaps**  
  There were noticeable differences in experience and familiarity with tools among team members. Some had advanced technical knowledge while others were still learning, which caused task imbalances and delays.

- 💬 **Asynchronous Communication**  
  Most of our communication happened on WhatsApp and other asynchronous platforms due to differing schedules. While this kept the team connected, it made quick decision-making and technical alignment harder.

---

### 🔁 Retrospective – Lessons Learned & Recommendations

| Observation | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Sprint overlapped with vacations and internships | Use availability calendars before sprints and assign critical tasks accordingly |
| Technical experience levels varied | Encourage mentoring, pair programming, and mini knowledge-sharing sessions |
| Members changed locations often | Set fixed weekly check-ins regardless of location, with summaries for absentees |
| Overreliance on asynchronous chats | Use shared tools (Notion, Miro) for central task tracking and decisions |
| Lack of documented decisions | Rotate a note-taker each meeting and maintain a visible sprint log |

---

### 📌 Looking Ahead – Sprint 3 Goals

- Begin backend integration: user authentication, HR module, and user data handling
- Complete gamification system implementation
- Prepare and execute early user testing for core flows
- Improve internal processes through better scheduling and knowledge alignment
